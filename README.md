## Note

This app's backend file is from an online course, and I haven't learned the backend yet.

I'm also developing this app on a mobile phone, so there might be some console errors since the console isn't fully usable on mobile. I will fix them when I get a laptop.

I'm still learning English, so please forgive any mistakes.
Thanks for reading my `README.me`
